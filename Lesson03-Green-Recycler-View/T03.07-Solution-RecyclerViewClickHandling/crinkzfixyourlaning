First death should clue you in to them having a lane ward that saw you going into the side.
It's likely that supports check the side anyways, but just the way they both walked was really fishy and lane wards are so common (if you check some of my replays, I buy a sentry when I think/pretty sure they have a lane ward)
Once you came back, you firestormed the wave for 0 reason. The creeps could've also been aggroed to be harder for SS to deny you deeper under tower (they would also have had more HP for you to do this if you didn't firestorm for no reason). This would've given you level 2 if you didn't get denied.
Even more reason to believe they have a lane ward is kunkka walked up as soon as you did. It's 100 free EXP.
The creeps pushed up to you again at 3 minutes and then you firestormed again for no reason. Those are all free last hits along with the next wave if you didn't firestorm and aggroed the creeps to be closer to you.
Kunkka walked through vision to go through the trees at 3:30.
If you're more worried about surviving than sustaining, save for boots instead of finishing wand.
The concept of "just firestorm and push the wave" is for breaking the lane equilibrium and pushing it into the enemy tower so hard that 2 waves are under it so it pushes back onto you afterwards.
I'm sure you've fucked up so much that there's no point watching past 5 min.
